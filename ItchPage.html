<p>Set in the 1930's fictional town of Dalesville you take on the role of a conniving councilman bent on destruction. 
With the help of gangs and the mob you must take down the Mayor and destroy the city while dodging suspicion from your fellow councilmen. 
With careful planning you might be able to outsmart the Mayor once and for all...</p>

<p>This game was created for The AI & Games Jam 2021. The AI opponent, known only as the mayor is a Utility AI driven system that scores actions 
based on how the player and city is performing. If you would like to see the decision process for each turn you can press ` twice to open up the console.</p>
